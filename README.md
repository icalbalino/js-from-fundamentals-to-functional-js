# js-from-fundamentals-to-functional-js

**by** _ical balino_

_"Functional programming is about verbs, object oriented programming is about the nouns"_

Strengthen your understanding of tricky JavaScript concepts by : 
- Understanding how to use functional utility methods
- Understanding how to implement those methods
- Applying JS fundamentals throughout the process
- Adding some related ES6 features

## Objects

**Overview**
1. Property Access
2. Dot vs Bracket
3. Destructuring
4. Nesting + Loops  
5. Nesting + Destructuring

Anything that ever uses a dot in JavaScript is an object.

Primitive values get pass by value, while non-Primitive values get pass by reference.

### Property Access
- Assignments with Dots
- Access with Dots
- Arrays

### Dot vs Bracket
- Brackets (bracket notation)
- Non-valid Characters
- THE RULES
    **Dots**
    1. strings
    2. numbers
    3. quotations
    4. weird characters
    5. expressions
 
    **Brackets**
    1. strings
    2. numbers
    3. variables
    4. weird characters
    5. expressions
